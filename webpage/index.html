    <h1>Welcome to my homepage!</h1>
    <p>My name is Roxanne Mackinnon, nice to meet you! I am a proud Baltimorean from birth and a software engineer. I graduated in 2023 from Williams College with a B.A. in computer science.</p>
    <p>When I was in school, I was mainly interested in low-level computing. I made it my goal to understand systems from the ground up. Ever since I was a kid, computers were magical to me, and I wanted to learn how to make magic myself. While completing my degree, many of my projects were recreations of things which already exist, such as web servers, 3D image renderers, neural networks, and garbage collection systems. Now that I've graduated, I've shifted my focus to full-stack web development, Android applications, and the Spring framework.</p>
    <p>Here are some pictures of my friends and from my life, with descriptions.</p>

    <p>As a younger child, I was involved with 4H. This is a picture of myself showing a sheep known as Heatherbell.</p>

    <p>During our senior winter break, me and my friends travelled 3 hours north of our school to Burlington, VT and spent the weekend exploring the town. This is us about to enjoy some delicious vietnamese pho!</p>
